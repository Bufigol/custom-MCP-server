* Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful

### Pull Requests

* Fill in the required template

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * üö± `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
